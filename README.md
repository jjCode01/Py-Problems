## [Collatz Conjecture (3n + 1 problem)](./projects/collatz_conjecture/)

Given a set of integers, this program calculates the sequence of numbers (steps) for each integer following the rules of [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):

* If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term (*n / 2*).
* If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1 (*3n + 1*).

The results are displayed on a graph.
